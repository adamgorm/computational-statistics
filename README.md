# Computational Statistics projects

The four mini projects deal with

1. density estimation,
2. rejection sampling,
3. the EM algorithm, and
4. stochastic gradient descent.

Each of the projects contain several implementations and slides comparing and
explaining them.

The projects are from the fall 2021, where I took the course Computational
Statistics at UCPH.
