# Mini projects for the Computational Statistics course (fall 2021)

Each of the mini projects consists of multiple implementations of solutions to a
statistical problem (density estimation, rejection sampling, the EM algorithm,
and stochastic gradient descent) and slides comparing and explaining them.
